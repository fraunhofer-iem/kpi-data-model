# Limit Type
Limit types provide a way to categorize [limits](limit.md), and, subsequently, their indicated [problems](limitProblem.md).  
For example, the limit type `WARNING` indicates that the limit indicates impending problems but does not require immediate action. The limit type `ERROR`, however, indicates that the limit detects situations that require immediate resolution.  
Companies can define their own limit types.
