# Limit Problem
Limit problems describe specific error situations, that may occur in the [entity](entity.md) referenced by the [KPI](kpi.md) the [limit](limit.md) is assigned to.  
In more detail, a limit problem shows, depending on the violated bound, which of the entity's [issues](issue.md) occurs. Additionally, it specifies one of the issue's [causes](cause.md) as explanation, and suggests one of the cause's [solutions](solution.md) to resolve the error.  
A limit can have multiple limit problems per bound. In this case, we require a prioritization in order to be able to list the problems in descending order of probability.
