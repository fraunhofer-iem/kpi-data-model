# KPI Type
A KPI type describes a reference value in general.  
For each [entity](entity.md), that is subject to this reference value, a [KPI](kpi.md) of this type is instantiated.  
The KPI type lists which [features](feature.md) are evaluated by its instances. Furthermore, KPI types are organized [hierarchically](kpiTypeHierarchy.md) placing restrictions on the KPI [hierarchy](kpiHierarchy.md).
