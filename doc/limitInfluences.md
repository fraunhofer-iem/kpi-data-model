# Limit Influences
The acceptable value ranges of reference values depend on the environmental [influences](influence.md) an [entity](entity.md) is currently subject to.  
Therefore, we define a [limit](limit.md) for each possible constellation of influences assigned to the entity.  
Limit influences denote for which influence constellation the respective limit is valid. During evaluation, we ignore a limit if any of its limit influences did not manifest.
